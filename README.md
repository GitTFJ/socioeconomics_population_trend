Code to run analysis for the manuscript: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.30.470341v2

Code is run in R. All dependencies and OS requirements are listed in the file 'session_info.rds'. To run this code, atleast 8GB of RAM will be required.

All code should be run from one script 'runV0.1.R'. In this code, we have commented out all sections of the code that produce the covariates as this requires many GBs of data that would need to be sourced from an array of locations. All of this data is in the public domain but needs data agreements to gain access e.g. Living Planet data. Instead, we provide the summarised data to run the models and produce our visualisations.

With 8GB of RAM and i5 processor, code will take circa 3 weeks to run.
